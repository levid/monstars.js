Monstar Lab MVC
===========

A Javascript framework, using [MooTools](http://mootools.net) as the Core. Built for [Monstar Lab](http://monstarlab.com).

How to use
----------

Models take care of all storage types, such as SQL, Ajax, XML, File, etc.

Controllers handle all View events to make changes to the Model, and then re-render the view.

Views contain a template property, and additional logic in an onRender property. Views can be HTML, XML, RSS, JSON, Markdown, etc.
